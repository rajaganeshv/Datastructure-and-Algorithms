# Algorithm

This repository will have code for algorithms such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort etc.,

All the code are written for learning purposes or with the intent to have a better code.

Code are written in languages such as Java, JavaScript or SQL based on the use case.

1. Heap.java - Does In-Place Heap sort of an Array of objects of a class implements Comparable Interface, ex: String, Integer etc.,
2. Merge.java - Does Merge Sort of an Array of objects of a class implements Comparable Interface, ex: String, Integer etc.,
3. QuickRandomPivot.java - Does Quick Sort of an Array of objects of a class implements Comparable Interface, ex: String, Integer etc., - This algorithm uses Random Pivot.
4. TowerOfHanoi.java - is a solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem. Uses three towers and can take any number of discs. NOTE: Users Stack datastructure in Stack.java
5. Stack.java - Stack datastructure.
